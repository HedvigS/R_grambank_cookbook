#' Adds a column with the name of the language family.
#'
#' @param LanguageTable data-frame of CLDF table with minimally the columns  "Family_ID", "Name" and "Glottocode".
#' @param LanguageTable2 data-frame of CLDF-table with additional information on Families in case LanguageTable is lacking information on the names of some/all families.
#' @param verbose logical. If TRUE, function will report on languages not matched to a Family_name.
#' @return data-frame with Family_name column.
#' @note It is necessary that for every unique glottocode in Family_ID there is a row with a Glottocode and Name to match that. If there isn't, languages will have missing values for their Family_name even though they are not isolates.
#'  If The current LanguageTable lacks the required columns, consider using a combination of the LanguageTable and ValueTable of glottolog-cldf.
