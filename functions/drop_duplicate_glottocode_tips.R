#' If a language tree has tips with are matched to duplicate glottocodes, drop all but one at random. If there are tips which are dialects of the same language, you can choose to drop all but one.
#'
#' @param tree 	an object of class "phylo". Tip-labels need to be unique within the tree, but can represent duplicates of Glottocodes.
#' @param merge_dialects a logical specifying whether to replace dialect tip labels with the glottocode of the language that is their parent, and then drop all but one
#' @param LanguageTable data-frame of tip-labels matched to Glottocodes. Needs the columns "taxon" and "Glottocode". If merge_dialects == TRUE then the column "Language_level_ID" is also necessary in either LangugeTable or LanguageTable2.
#' @param LanguageTable2 data-frame of Glottocodes matched to Language_level_ID. If merge-dialects is TRUE and LanguageTable lacks the column 'Language_level_ID', LanguageTable2 needs to be specified. requires the columns "Glottocode" and "Language_level_ID".
#' @param rename_tips_to_glottocodes logical. If TRUE, the tip-labels of the output tree are renamed to the corresponding Glottocodes. If FALSE, the original tip-labels are retained.
#' @return tree without tips with duplicate Glottocodes, optionally all but one dialect is dropped as well.
