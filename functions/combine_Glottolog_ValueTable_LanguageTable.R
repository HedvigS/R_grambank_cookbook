#' Combines Glottolog-cldf ValueTable and LanguageTable, in an opinionated manner.
#'
#' @param Glottolog_LanguageTable data.frame
#' @param Glottolog_ValueTable data.frame
#' @return Data-frame with information from Glottolog's LanguageTable and ValueTabled joined
#' @note The information in "Comment" and "Source" from the ValueTable is not retained in the output data-frame. The column called "Language_ID" in LanguageTable is renamed to "Language_level_ID" to reduce confusion with foreign keys in other tables. The column ID in LanguageTable is renamed "Language_ID".
#' @return A data-frame that combines information from glottolog-cldf ValueTable and LanguageTable. See note for details on modifications.
